# Paradigm-1955C

## Inhabitant of the Deep Sea
For this evidence, the problem used was 
https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1955/C

The problem is as follows, there are n ships on the sea, for each ship (i), the durability is defined by a_i. Suddenly, a Kraken comes out of the sea and attacks the fleet. The pattern of attack is on the this order:
1. The Kraken attacks the first ship.
2. The Kraken attacks the last ship.

*Note: Each blow from the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1.*
The number of attacks make by the Kraken is defined by k, after the attacks end, the Kraken leaves, and only the ships with a durability over 0, are still standing.

Â¿How many ships has the Kraken taken down after the attack?
